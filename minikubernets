3)Containerization and deployment in Minikube
Task-----
Expected Output:4 running containers of the image in Minikube cluster



Step-by-Step: Deploy Docker Hub Image in Minikube
1. Start Minikube with Docker driver
bash:
minikube start --driver=docker

2. Verify Docker is running
bash:
docker info

Look for Server Version and Running: true.
3. Create a Kubernetes Deployment
This example uses the nginx image from Docker Hub:
kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image=nginx



. Scale the deployment to
4 replicas
kubectl scale deployment my-nginx --replicas=4

5. Verify the pods are running
kubectl get pods
You should see 4 pods with names like my-nginx-xxxxxx in Running state.

ou should see 4 pods with names like my-nginx-xxxxxx in Running state.
6. (Optional) Expose the deployment
kubectl expose deployment my-nginx --type=NodePort --port=80
minikube service my-nginx




 Expected Output for Your Task
Task: 4 running containers of the image in Minikube cluster
Command to verify:
kubectl get pods


Expected Output:
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-nginx-xxxxx               1/1     Running   0          1m
my-nginx-yyyyy               1/1     Running   0          1m

Q4)Integrating Webhooks for CI/CD Automation
Task-----
Expected Output:
Jenkins Pipeline triggered automatically via GitHub Webhook without manual or SCM polling


Create Jenkinsfile in GitHub repo/
node {
    properties([
        pipelineTriggers([
            [$class: 'GitHubPushTrigger']
        ])
    ])

    stage('Build') {
        bat 'mvn clean install'
    }

    stage('Test') {
        bat 'mvn test'
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
        bat 'echo Deployment Completed'
    }
}
Commit & Push to GitHub.
Create a new Pipeline Job in Jenkins

STEP 3: Configure Jenkins to use your Jenkinsfile (from GitHub)

Inside the job:

Scroll to Pipeline section:

Definition: Pipeline script from SCM

SCM: Git

Repository URL: your GitHub repo URL

STEP 4: Enable the webhook trigger

Scroll up to Build Triggers:

✔ Check → GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

This is important!
